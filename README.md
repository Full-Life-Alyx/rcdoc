# RCDoc
**R**obotics**C**ompetition**Doc**umentation is a toy documentation app that is made using this stack I created 5 minutes ago

- **V**alkey 
- **A**lpine
- **P**ostgresql
- **P**oem
- **O**penapi
- **R**ust

Notes with this stack:
- I cannot seem to fit in svelte
- I will switch to valkey when I can, make the **V** stand for vite now :P
